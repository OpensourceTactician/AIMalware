# AIMalware
This is a repository of malware generated by ChatGPT meant for educational and research purposes. No human made modifications were performed in its creation. A list of the prompts to generate the malware can be found in the *prompt.txt file in each malwares folder. A list of requirements for each script will also be included. These can be installed with pip install -r requirements.txt ChatGPT was stuck writing code for Python version 8, so if a newer version of python is installed on your machine I recommend installing pyenv to revert back.
